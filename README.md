Please make sure to list the five learning rates compared in your experiment.
2. A paragraph (5-10 sentences) comparing the results in your line chart from the second experiment. What trends did you observe about the agent’s learning? How did the agent’s performance change as you varied the exploration rate 𝜖? Which exploration rate did you find led to the best performance? Please make sure to list the five exploration rates compared in your experiment.
3. Based on your results from both experiments, what advice would you offer someone new to reinforcement learning about how to choose appropriate values for 𝛼 and 𝜖?
4. A short paragraph describing your experience during the assignment (what did you enjoy, what was difficult, etc.)
